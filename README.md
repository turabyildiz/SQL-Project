# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals

My goals are to answer the questions provided and the questions i make while cleaning and QAing the dataset in the process to ensure a higher level of quality.

## Process

1. Began with importing the data to the tables, and realized some columns are completely empty. At first, i tried to not include them at all, but this was giving me tons of errors. I included them with the corresponding data types and things went smoothly.

2. As i started to work on the first few questions, it became clear to me that the database was rough around the edges and needed some cleaning/QA. I started small, with null or strange values, then worked my way up to conversions of data types and values as needed.

## Results

1. This data tells me lots of information, but it is scattered around the dataset. After finding my answers, (for example, i had to manually calculate the transaction revenue by joining another table and doing some math) I believe i suceeded in answering most, if not all of the questions made and provided.

## Challenges

1. The fact that this is a different database (not northwind) threw me way off. I spent a good chunk of time just trying to wrap my head around this database, and the intentional lower quality of this database got to me as well.

2. It was a good test of my knowledge. I had to request assiatance multiple times on this project, whether it was for basic data importing or it was for a question in the project. I used clauses I actually almost never used, such as the CASE clause. Although i have experience with python, its interesting to challenge myself and see how it differs with SQL. Conversion to timestamps were also very tricky for me!

## Future Goals

If i had more time, i would relax, take a breath, and work on this database fully from the bottom up. Personally, i dont like to see unneeded inconsistencies, no matter how small. I learned lots about myself and my working behaviors throughout this project! I dont know if it is my mental way of life or not, because in person i am not the most organized. But when it comes to coding, i love it tidy. Even as i write this i will have to force myself to take a break as i feel i am pushing myself too hard.

For the future, i want to not stress myself out so much and take my time going through problems in order to get closer to achieving my "ideal" database. I will be kind to myself, and to the database im working with.
